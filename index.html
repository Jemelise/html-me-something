            <h1>The Prowl</h1>    
            <h4>written by: Selina Kyle | October 28, 1992</h4>
            <p>Every once in a blue moon I crawl across one of those lady-kilers. 
               You know the type: Piercing gaze, curled shoulders, never remembers your name.
               He stopped me in my tracks on 5th and Monroe. Let me rephrase that. His victim 
               caught my ear. Her scream was as weak as her patent leather shoes. Did she know
               the danger that was in store for her? Makes you wonder. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <em>"It's been a long day and I have decent loot to get home."</em>
            <br>
            <br>
            <em>"Shit."</em>
            <br>
            <br>
            <em>"I'll stash it and come back for it later. This will only take ten minutes."</em>
            <br>
            <br>
            If I had dime for how many times I intervened in someone else's mess I wouldn't need
            to be out every night. Better make that a dollar. I hid my treasure under a dirty blanket on the
            corner of a rooftop. Dont want to know where <em>that's</em> been.
            I held my breath as I hurled my whip and swung to the third floor of the building. One more 
            swing. I landed harder than I usually do and scuffed my knee. She only gets five minutes.
            I skulk behind him, hearing more clearly the threats he's promising her if she screams again. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <em>"When is it my turn? I don't like to be left out."</em>
            <br>
            <br> 
            The sheer panic in his eyes; that's why I do this. I back handed him my steel stiletto. Back footed?
            He fell and rushed his hand to his freshly wounded face. That's the handywork of welding 
            a cheese grater to the soles. Thanks for the tip, Ivy. Another man running 
            away from me. Until next time, lady-killer.
